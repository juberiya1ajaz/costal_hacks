# Explorer l'océan

## 💡 Inspiration

Most travelers are guilty of one thing while wandering through beaches and oceans, they either pollute the beaches or ignore the pollution caused by others. Cleaning the beaches is as necessary as preventive measures. To tackle this issue, We focused on developing a feasible solution to encourage travelers to clean the beaches throughout the brainstorming process. At Explorer l'océan, you can use our beach theme filters but here is the twist, to use the filter you will have to upload before and after pictures after cleaning up the beaches. On top of that, you will also get NFTs using which you can mine it and earn some cryptos.

## 💻 What it does

- Upload an image of a dirty beach, and then an image of a clean beach. Once the ML model identifies the correct difference user will get an NFT using which they can mine it and earn some cryptos.
- You can make your own NFT and mine them.
- A collection of NFTs (or cleaned beaches) can be found on the NFT page.
- Keep track of the braches you visited.
<!-- - Web app is available in multiple languages. -->

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Solidity: For smart contract
- Hedera: For deploying Smart Contract
- Tensorflow.js: For ML and disease prediction
- Google Teachable Machine: For training the model
- i18n: For multi-language support
- Tailwind: For styling and animations

## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using Hedera’s testnet to **deploy smart contracts** for our app. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.
