# Explorer l'océan

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Solidity: For smart contract
- Hedera: For deploying Smart Contract
- Tensorflow.js: For ML and disease prediction
- Google Teachable Machine: For training the model
- i18n: For multi-language support
- Tailwind: For styling and animations

## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using Hedera’s testnet to **deploy smart contracts** for our app. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.
